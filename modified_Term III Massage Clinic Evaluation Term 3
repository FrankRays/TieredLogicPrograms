Zhilong’s comments :

1.	For more details specifically between client module and corresponding database attributes, tables and constraints, you can reference my new SQL script, code and ERD.  
2.	For an informal description of the client module pattern can be transformed database table and related attributes regarding principle of database modeling with ERD to different types of entities shown as attached SQL script in the sources code part. The part of other modules are probably the most similar this pattern with transformative mechanism in the first module and its child items described. Please note that words with red color comments to explain how to transform between client evaluation form and database tables, attributes. I applied rows constraints in referential integration with parent entity and its weak entity in a recursive way to create RDB tables from client evaluation modules. And another aspect of design, I think that it is necessary to use primary keys and its corresponding foreign keys in student_id and finished_date attributes to each row. Although it could be a little bit of denormalization, and needs a bit more space, it can take many advantages of writing sql statements become much simple and easier. Moreover, it also can identify the same records except each different finished date only to be stored in the tables. It can be used for statistic certain student grades from those historical grades to create graph available to meet client request.  
3.	For other modules of the two documents shown <Mss 3041 Teacher Student OSCE Background Information-Final 2013.docx> and <Mss NEW 3030 & 3040 Treatment OSCE  2013 copy.docx > client provided, I try to do them as well recently.

Professionalism Issues:













Date_________ Student_________________________ Supervisor________________________

 This section concerns areas that are not specifically evaluated in the term 3 module format. There are approximately 80 modules that cover all of the areas for entrance to practice. We cannot test all 80 modules but select a variety of modules for each term. Therefor the supervisor needs to be able to evaluate students on over arching content areas. These areas are Communication, Professionalism, Documentation and Safety. If your supervisor finds that you are weak and/or failing any of these areas, you will be directed to remediate this content area. This information can be found in the other modules that are not being specifically tested in your term.
